        The purpose of a literature review is to:

        Place each work in the context of its contribution to understanding the research problem being studied.
        Describe the relationship of each work to the others under consideration.
        Identify new ways to interpret prior research.
        Reveal any gaps that exist in the literature.
        Resolve conflicts amongst seemingly contradictory previous studies.
        Identify areas of prior scholarship to prevent duplication of effort.
        Point the way in fulfilling a need for additional research.
        Locate your own research within the context of existing literature [very important].
